As part of our ongoing efforts to understand and combat obesity globally, we're leveraging data to gain insights into factors contributing to obesity.

    "- NCP (Number of main meals): Represents the number of main meals the individual has in a day.\n",
    "- CAEC (Consumption of food between meals): Shows how frequently the individual eats between meals.\n",
    "- CH20 (Consumption of water daily): Details the daily water consumption.\n",
